                        Education </abbr> </span> </strong> is the process of
            facilitating learning, or the acquisition of knowledge, skills, values, morals, beliefs, and habits.
            Educational methods include teaching, training, storytelling, discussion and directed research. Education
            frequently takes place under the guidance of educators, however learners can also educate themselves.
            Education can take place in formal or informal settings and any experience that has a formative effect on
            the way one thinks, feels, or acts may be considered educational. The methodology of teaching is called
            pedagogy. Formal education is commonly divided formally into such stages as preschool or kindergarten,
            primary school, secondary school and then college, university, or apprenticeship.
            A right to education has been recognized by some governments and the United Nations.[a] In most regions,
            education is compulsory up to a certain age. <b>There is a movement for education reform, and in particular
                for
                evidence-based education with global initiatives aimed at achieving the Sustainable Development Goal 4,
                which promotes quality education for all.</b></article>

        <blockquote>The education system that we see in today's Bangladesh is basically inherited from British-India.
            Expansion of education among the mass people started during that period. However,<mark> Bangladesh's
                independence of 1971 opened the door for the country to adopting development strategies in all sectors
                of human life, including education sector development. </mark> The country has undoubtedly made
            remarkable progress in the field of education over the last few decades. The government policies regarding
            development of this particular sector, community initiatives, and involvement of the non-government
            organisations (NGOs) collectively, made this possible. Yet, a lot remains unfinished. Expansion of education
            in some areas, combating corruption in the education sector, assurance of quality and parity, and removal of
            discrimination at all levels of education are the big challenges of our education system. Samir Ranjan
            Nath's book 'Realising Potential: Bangladesh's Experiences in Education' is an attempt to look back at the
            journey of Bangladesh in the field of education during the period of 1971 - 2015. The author minutely
            examines the policies and plans in the education sector and identifies disparities as well as areas for
            improvement in this crucial sector.</blockquote>
